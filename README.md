# MoveitFileUploader

No configurations needed. At the start it only asks for a username and a password for a MoveIT Transfer account. There are two commands - setting a local folder path and scanning the local folder. It automatically adds the new file if there are any.

NOTE: The server API url can be changed in the helper MoveItCommunicator. As of right now it's on the test server, but it can easily be changed to https://progress.moveitcloud.com/api/v1/ as well. It will still work as the API has the same urls as the test one.
